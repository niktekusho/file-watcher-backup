**DISCLAIMER**: *ðŸŽ‰ This is my first attempt at building something in Rust so I am sure the code could be better. ðŸŽ‰*

This is a CLI application that "backups" a file using a watcher approach: whenever the specifed file's content changes this application copies the file into the specified target directory (maintaining the original file name).
